                <p>I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel">Turbo Laravel</a> - a package that
                    bridges Hotwire with Laravel, and although I have done an <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/qqLVbd_uGiI?t=171">introduction
                        to Hotwire</a> before, I didn't really dive into using the package itself (lol, right?). And I also
                    didn't cover the <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/native">Turbo Native</a> aspect of building
                    applications this way, so… it’s time!</p>
                <h2 id="screencasts">Screencasts</h2>
                <p>If you enjoy video content, I’ve recorded 3 videos showing the building blocks of using this
                    technique.</p>
                <h3 id="01-hotwire-101">01 Hotwire 101</h3>
                <p>In the first episode, I cover what <a href="https://hotwire.dev/">Hotwire</a> is, going over the concepts
                    of Turbo Drive, Turbo Frames, and Turbo Streams over HTTP (as responses). The demo application uses a
                    Laravel app. We end up having to do a lot of boilerplate to get things to work (such as request
                    validations).</p>

                <p>For the second episode, it’s time to introduce the <a
                        href="https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel">Turbo
                        Laravel</a> package and solve some of the pain-points we saw on the previous video. I also take the
                    opportunity to show how to broadcast Turbo Streams over WebSockets, and for that I go over how to setup
                    the <a href="https://beyondco.de/docs/laravel-websockets/getting-started/introduction">Laravel
                        WebSockets</a> package with <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail">Laravel Sail</a> so you can
                    test it all locally.</p>

                <h3 id="03-turbo-native">03 Turbo Native</h3>
                <p>For the third and last episode, I go over the <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/native">Turbo
                        Native</a> aspect of Hotwire. The Basecamp folks prepared a <a
                        href="https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-android/tree/main/demo">demo app</a> for us, so I’ll use
                    that to show the technique. A little disclaimer here: I’m no mobile developer. I’ve done an Android
                    development course once, but it was a long time ago. Anyways, I think this is a really powerful way of
                    building hybrid applications and allows you to enhance your mobile apps per page and as much fidelity as
                    you need.</p>

                <h2 id="hotwire--laravel">Hotwire &amp; Laravel</h2>
                <p>The <a href="https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel">Turbo Laravel</a> package is pretty much done. I
                    haven’t tagged v1 yet because I’m waiting on the <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/">Turbo.js</a>
                    library to get stable as well, although I can’t seen anything changing that would force me to change a
                    lot (the integration surface of the backend and Turbo.js is really small).</p>
                <p>I thought of writing a longer version of an introduction to the package itself (some kind of Getting
                    Started), but I think that both the <a href="https://turbo.hotwire.dev/handbook/introduction">Turbo
                        Handbook</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/tonysm/turbo-laravel">Turbo Laravel
                        documentation</a> really covers a lot of what is possible. So, for now, I’ll just reference them.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy the videos. Please, let me know if I said something wrong.</p>
